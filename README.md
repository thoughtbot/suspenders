# Suspenders

[![CI](https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Suspenders is a [Rails Engine][] containing generators for configuring Rails
applications with these [features][].

It is used by thoughtbot to get a jump start on a new or existing app. Use
Suspenders if you're in a rush to build something amazing; don't use it if you
like missing deadlines.

## Requirements

- Rails `~> 7.0`
- Ruby `>= 3.1`
- Node `>= 20.0.0`

## Usage

Suspenders can be used to create a new Rails application, or to enhance an
existing Rails application.

### With New Rails Applications

This approach uses an [application template][] to generate a new Rails
application with Suspenders.

We skip the [default test framework][] in favor of [RSpec][], and [prefer
PostgreSQL][] as our database.

We skip [RuboCop rules by default][] in favor of our [holistic linting rules][].

#### Use the latest suspenders release:

```
rails new app_name \
 --skip-rubocop \
 --skip-test \
 -d=postgresql \
 -m=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/suspenders/main/lib/install/web.rb
```

#### OR use the current (possibly unreleased) `main` branch of suspenders:

```
rails new app_name \
 --suspenders-main \
 --skip-rubocop \
 --skip-test \
 -d=postgresql \
 -m=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/suspenders/main/lib/install/web.rb
```

Then run `bin/setup` within the newly generated application.

Alternatively, if you're using our [dotfiles][], then you can just run `rails new
app_name`, or create your own [railsrc][] file with the following configuration:

```
--skip-rubocop
--skip-test
--database=postgresql
-m=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/suspenders/main/lib/install/web.rb
```

### With Existing Rails Applications

Suspenders can be used on an existing Rails application by adding it to the
`:development` and `:test` group.

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem "suspenders"
end
```

Once installed, you can invoke the web installation generator, which will
invoke all generators.

```
bin/rails g suspenders:install:web
```

Or, you can invoke generators individually. To see a list of available
generators run:

```
bin/rails g | grep suspenders
```

To learn more about a generator, run:

```
bin/rails g suspenders:[generator_name] --help
```

### Available Tasks

Suspenders ships with several custom Rake tasks.

```
bin/rails suspenders:rake
bin/rails suspenders:db:migrate
bin/rails suspenders:cleanup:organize_gemfile
```
