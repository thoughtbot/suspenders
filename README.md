## Installation

First install the suspenders gem:

    gem install suspenders

Then run:

    suspenders projectname

This will create a Rails app in `projectname` using the latest version of Rails.

## Gemfile

To see the latest and greatest gems, look at Suspenders'
[Gemfile](templates/Gemfile.erb), which will be appended to the default
generated projectname/Gemfile.

It includes application gems like:

* [Rack Timeout](https://github.com/kch/rack-timeout) to abort requests that are
  taking too long
* [Recipient Interceptor](https://github.com/croaky/recipient_interceptor) to
  avoid accidentally sending emails to real people from staging

  objects
* [ByeBug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug) for interactively
  debugging behavior
* [Bundler Audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit) for scanning the
  Gemfile for insecure dependencies based on published CVEs
* [Spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) for fast Rails actions via
  pre-loading
* [Web Console](https://github.com/rails/web-console) for better debugging via
  in-browser IRB consoles.

  RSpec matchers
* [Timecop](https://github.com/jtrupiano/timecop-console) for testing time

## Other goodies

Suspenders also comes with:

* The [`./bin/setup`][setup] convention for new developer setup
* The `./bin/deploy` convention for deploying to Heroku
* Rails' flashes set up and in application layout
* A few nice time formats set up for localization
* `Rack::Deflater` to [compress responses with Gzip][compress]
* A [low database connection pool limit][pool]
* [Safe binstubs][binstub]

  environments

## Heroku

You can optionally create Heroku staging and production apps:

    suspenders app --heroku true

This:

* Creates a staging and production Heroku app
* Sets them as `staging` and `production` Git remotes
* Configures staging with `RACK_ENV` and `RAILS_ENV` environment variables set
  to `staging`
* Adds the [Rails Stdout Logging][logging-gem] gem
  to configure the app to log to standard out,
  which is how [Heroku's logging][heroku-logging] works.

[logging-gem]: https://github.com/heroku/rails_stdout_logging
[heroku-logging]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging#writing-to-your-log

You can optionally specify alternate Heroku flags:

    suspenders app \
      --heroku true \
      --heroku-flags "--region eu --addons newrelic,pgbackups,sendgrid,ssl"

See all possible Heroku flags:

    heroku help create

## Git

This will initialize a new git repository for your Rails app. You can
bypass this with the `--skip-git` option:

    suspenders app --skip-git true

## GitHub

You can optionally create a GitHub repository for the suspended Rails app. It
requires that you have [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub) on your system:

    curl http://hub.github.com/standalone -sLo ~/bin/hub && chmod +x ~/bin/hub
    suspenders app --github organization/project

This has the same effect as running:

    hub create organization/project

## Dependencies

Suspenders requires the latest version of Ruby.

Some gems included in Suspenders have native extensions. You should have GCC
installed on your machine before generating an app with Suspenders.

Use [OS X GCC Installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/) for
Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6).

Use [Command Line Tools for XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
for Lion (OS X 10.7) or Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8).

We use [Capybara Webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit) for
full-stack JavaScript integration testing. It requires QT. Instructions for
installing QT are
[here](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit).

PostgreSQL needs to be installed and running for the `db:create` rake task.
