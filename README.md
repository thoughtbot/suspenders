Installation
------------

First install the suspenders gem:

    gem install suspenders

Then run:

    suspenders projectname

This will create a Rails 4.0 app in `projectname`. This script creates a
new git repository. It is not meant to be used against an existing repo.

    heroku create app-production --remote production

Github
------

You can optionally create a Github repository:

    suspenders app --github organization/project

Suspenders requires Ruby 1.9.2 or greater.

Some gems included in Suspenders have native extensions. You should have GCC
installed on your machine before generating an app with Suspenders.

Use [OS X GCC Installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/) for
Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6).
