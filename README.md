Installation
------------

First install the suspenders gem:

    gem install suspenders

Then run:

    suspenders projectname

This will create a Rails 3.2 app in `projectname`. This script creates a
new git repository. It is not meant to be used against an existing repo.

Gemfile
-------

To see the latest and greatest gems, look at Suspenders'
[templates/Gemfile_clean](templates/Gemfile_clean),
which will be appended to the default generated projectname/Gemfile.

It includes application gems like:

* [Airbrake](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake) for exception notification
* [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) for Sass mixins
* [Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) for form markup and style

And testing gems like:

* [Bourne](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourne) and
  [Mocha](https://github.com/freerange/mocha) for stubbing and spying
* [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) and
  [Capybara Webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit) for
  integration testing
* [Factory Girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl) for test data
* [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) for unit testing
* [Shoulda Matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers) for common
  RSpec matchers
* [Timecop](https://github.com/jtrupiano/timecop-console) for testing time

Other goodies
-------------

Suspenders also comes with:

* Override recipient emails in staging environment.
* Rails' flashes set up and in application layout.
* A few nice time formats set up for localization.
* [Heroku-recommended asset pipeline
  settings](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails3x-asset-pipeline-cedar/).

Heroku
------

You can optionally create Heroku staging and production apps:

    suspenders app --heroku true

This has the same effect as running:

    heroku create app-staging --remote staging
    heroku create app-production --remote production

Github
------

You can optionally create a Github repository:

    suspenders app --github organization/project

This has the same effect as running:

    hub create organization/project
