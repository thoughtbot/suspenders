Installation
------------

First install the suspenders gem:

    gem install suspenders

Then run:

    suspenders projectname

This will create a Rails app in `projectname` using the latest version of Rails.

By default this script creates a new git repository. See below if you
want to use it against an existing repo.

Gemfile
-------

[Gemfile](templates/Gemfile.erb), which will be appended to the default

Heroku
------

You can optionally create Heroku staging and production apps:

    suspenders app --heroku true

This:

* Creates a staging and production Heroku app
* Sets them as `staging` and `production` Git remotes
* Configures staging with `RACK_ENV` and `RAILS_ENV` environment variables set
  to `staging`

Git
---

This will initialize a new git repository for your Rails app. You can
bypass this with the `--skip-git` option:

    suspenders app --skip-git true

GitHub
------

You can optionally create a GitHub repository for the suspended Rails app. It
requires that you have [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub) on your system:

    curl http://hub.github.com/standalone -sLo ~/bin/hub && chmod +x ~/bin/hub
    suspenders app --github organization/project

This has the same effect as running:

    hub create organization/project

Dependencies
------------

Suspenders requires the latest version of Ruby.

Some gems included in Suspenders have native extensions. You should have GCC
installed on your machine before generating an app with Suspenders.

Use [OS X GCC Installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/) for
Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6).

Use [Command Line Tools for XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
for Lion (OS X 10.7) or Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8).

We use [Capybara Webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit) for
full-stack JavaScript integration testing. It requires QT. Instructions for
installing QT are
[here](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit).

PostgreSQL needs to be installed and running for the `db:create` rake task.
