First install the suspenders gem:

    gem install suspenders

Then run:

    suspenders projectname

This will create a Rails app in `projectname` using the latest version of Rails.

### Associated services

* Enable [GitHub auto deploys to Heroku staging and review
    apps](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/app-name-staging/deploy/github).

## Heroku

Read the documentation on [deploying to Heroku][heroku deploy]

You can optionally create Heroku staging and production apps:

    suspenders app --heroku true

This:

* Creates a staging and production Heroku app
* Sets them as `staging` and `production` Git remotes
* Configures staging with `HONEYBADGER_ENV` environment variable set
  to `staging`
* Creates a [Heroku Pipeline] for review apps
* Schedules automated backups for 10AM UTC for both `staging` and `production`

[Heroku Pipeline]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pipelines
[heroku deploy]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders/blob/master/docs/heroku_deploy.md

You can optionally specify alternate Heroku flags:

    suspenders app \
      --heroku true \
      --heroku-flags "--region eu --addons sendgrid,ssl"

See all possible Heroku flags:

    heroku help create

## Git

This will initialize a new git repository for your Rails app. You can
bypass this with the `--skip-git` option:

    suspenders app --skip-git true

## GitHub

You can optionally create a GitHub repository for the suspended Rails app. It
requires that you have [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub) on your system:

    curl https://hub.github.com/standalone -sLo ~/bin/hub && chmod +x ~/bin/hub
    suspenders app --github organization/project

This has the same effect as running:

    hub create organization/project

## Spring

Suspenders uses [spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) by default.
It makes Rails applications load faster, but it might introduce confusing issues
around stale code not being refreshed.
If you think your application is running old code, run `spring stop`.
And if you'd rather not use spring, add `DISABLE_SPRING=1` to your login file.

## Dependencies

Suspenders requires the latest version of Ruby.

Some gems included in Suspenders have native extensions. You should have GCC
installed on your machine before generating an app with Suspenders.

Use [OS X GCC Installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/) for
Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6).

Use [Command Line Tools for Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
for Lion (OS X 10.7) or Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8).

We use [Google Chromedriver] for full-stack JavaScript integration testing. It
requires Google Chrome or Chromium.

[Google Chromedriver]: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home

PostgreSQL needs to be installed and running for the `db:create` rake task.
