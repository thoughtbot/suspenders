Some gems included in Suspenders have native extensions. You should have GCC installed on your

If you're running OS X, we recommend the [GCC OSX installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer).

We use [Capybara Webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit) for full-stack Javascript integration testing.
It requires you have QT installed on your machine before running Suspenders.
