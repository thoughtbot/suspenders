# <%= app_name.humanize %>

## Getting Started

After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

    % ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc.

## Seeded Data

Assuming that devise was opted in to, a user and admin have been seeded for you:

    admin@example.com -> asdfjkl123
    user_1@example.com -> asdfjkl123

## Static Pages

The HighVoltage gem is used.

## Authorization

This repo uses CanCanCan and Canard to authorize user action. `ApplicationController` defines the `check_authorization` method for non-devise non-high voltage controllers. If you want to skip authorization for a specific method in a controller, the following method can be used: `skip_authorization_check`

## Rubocop

Take a look at the `.rubocop.yml` file to see what styles are being enforced.

## Annotations

Model & spec files are automatically annotated each time `rake db:migrate` is run.
