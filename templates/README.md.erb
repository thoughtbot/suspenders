Getting Started
---------------

This repository comes equipped with a self-setup script:

    % ./bin/setup

After setting up, you can run the application using [foreman]:

    % foreman start

If you don't have [foreman], you can install it with `gem install foreman`. Note that it is not included in the `Gemfile` [nor should it be](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman/pull/437#issuecomment-41110407).
