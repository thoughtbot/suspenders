Getting Started
---------------

This repository comes equipped with a self-setup script!

    % ./bin/setup

After setting up, you can run the application using [foreman]:

    % foreman start

[foreman]: http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/

Check with your team to get the environment setup you may need - this shouldn't
be stored in Git, so it might be in Basecamp or Google Docs.

This should be stored in `.env` and not added to the repository.
