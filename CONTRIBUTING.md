## Testing the executable Locally

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
From there, you can run `suspenders new <app_name>` to test the current code.

In an effort to help distinguish code generated by `rails new` from code
generated by the application template, you can run `bin/qa`.

From there you can `cd qa` and run `git diff` to see what changed.

This can be useful for testing Suspenders after a new release of Rails.

## Documenting changes to generated application

Be sure to update `FEATURES.md` and the contents of `update_readme` within
`web.rb` anytime you add, update or remove a feature to the generated
application.

## Publishing to RubyGems

When the gem is ready to be shared as a formal release, it can be
[published][published] to RubyGems.

  [published]: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/plugins.html#publishing-your-gem

1. Bump the version number in `Suspenders::VERSION`
2. Run `bundle exec rake build`
3. Run `bundle exec rake install`
4. Run `bundle exec rake release`
